    <h2>Competition Rules!</h2>
    <p><span class="title">Duration:</span><br></br> The competition will run for six weeks.<br><br/>
        <span class="title">Initial funds:</span><br></br>RM50,000/account.<br></br>
        <span class="title">Tradable assets:</span><br></br> Participants can trade stocks listed on Bursa Malaysia. You can
        view the list of stocks <a href="https://www.malaysiastock.biz/Listed-Companies.aspx" target="_blank" id="here">HERE.</a><br></br>
        <span class="title"> Trading hours:</span><br></br>Participants can place trades anytime during the trading week
        (Monday to Friday), during regular market hours (9:00 AM - 12:30 PM and 2:30PM - 5:00 PM MST).<br></br>
        <span class="title">Trading restrictions:</span><br></br><span style="font-size: 30px; vertical-align: middle;">i.</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Participants are not allowed to trade on margin or short sell a stock.<br></br>

        <span style="font-size: 30px; vertical-align: middle;">ii.</span>&nbsp; Participants' account balance must be less than 50% by 5:00 PM daily to
        encourage active trading. If their balance is greater than or equal &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to 50%,
        they will be disqualified from the competition.</span><br></br>

        <span class="title">Scoring system:</span><br></br> Participants will earn points based on their profit and loss (P&L)
        during the competition period. The formula for calculating points is as follows:
        <br></br>
        <span id="points">Points = (P&L / Starting Account Balance) x 100. </span><br></br>
        <span class="title">Leaderboard:</span><br></br> The app will display a leaderboard that shows the top 10
        participants ranked by their total points earned during the competition period.<br></br>
        <span class="title">Notifications:</span><br></br>Participants will receive notifications when they enter or exit a
        position, and when their P&L crosses certain thresholds (e.g., RM1000 profit or
        RM500 loss). <br></br>
        <span class="title">Analytics and reporting:</span><br></br> The app provides participants with access to a
        dashboard where they can view their P&L, account balance, open positions, and
        trade history. Participants can also generate reports that show their performance
        metrics during the competition period.
